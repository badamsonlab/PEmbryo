# details on running provided scripts

Below are examples of command line arguments to run "PEmbryo_align_" .py scripts to evaluate editing efficiency on collected samples/datasets based on the specific target site and target edit. The scripts pull edit details and relevant filenames from 'PEmbryo_sample_sheet_master.xlsx'. Fastq files for the relevant samples, available through SRA, must be stored in a directory called "input_libraries/" or the path updated in the script.

Outputs generated by the "PEmbryo_align_" .py scripts (.fastq files containing reads with a determined outcome designation i.e. wild-type, precisely edited, or containing errors) are stored in the directory "output_libraries/" with subdirectories for "wt_reads/", "pe_reads/", and "error_reads/". A .log file is also generated to summarize the results.
